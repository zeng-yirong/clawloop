## Local Extension

The runner may expose one extra local-only tool when enabled:
- run_python: Execute Python code inside the workspace.

Use run_python only when it is useful for reliable data processing. The code
runs with the workspace as the current directory. Destructive operations,
absolute paths, shell commands, subprocess calls, and parent-directory access
are blocked by the runner.
